The program shows 5 different images over time and
collects gaze points from the eye tribe as one looks
at the images used. The gaze points are save to a 
 .tsv file. You have to manually change the name
for each new participant I was unable to figure that 
part out
At end of viewing image sequence it plays back the images 
with your eyetracking data in heatmap, scatterplot and scatterlineplot

Images are not included in the file you can insert you own
